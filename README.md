Just a program I made in my free time. You can use it to block usage of your system for regular intervals. Useful for people who want to remind themselves to take breaks regularly from their computer.

Make sure you run it as administrator.

Use Ctrl+Shift+K to kill program incase something goes wrong

A picture will show up every time the system gets blocked from you.
